I used the Unity engine for this project. I choose this software because I have a lot more experience with the software. <br>
It would give me an opportunity to focus on the scripts and the mechanic itself which will probably makes the game look and work a lot better then done within the other software.<br>
It would give me more time to think about the scripting without having to learn the engine itself first.
Furthermore the engine fits the internship where I want to go so having more projects in the Unity engine would benefit my skills and chance to get accepted.


## Learning goals 
- Learning different ways to create systems.
- Connections from one script to another.
- Writing single responcebility code.
