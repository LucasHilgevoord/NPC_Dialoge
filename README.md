## Software Anaylse 
The software that has been used in this project is the Unity Engine with the C# language.<br>
I tried using Javascript in the beginning of the project because it seemed easier to create lines and that was indeed the outcome.<br>
Then i made the switch to unity to learn a bit more about how it could be made within unity with the uses of meshes.

## Learning goals 
- How do meshes work within unity.
- Forumulas translated in code.
- etc. etc.
