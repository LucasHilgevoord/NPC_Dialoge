I used the Unity engine for this project. I choose this software because I have a lot more experience with the software.
It would give me an opportunity to focus on the scripts and the mechanic itself which will probably makes the game look and work a lot better then done within the other software.
It would give me more time to think about the scripting without having to learn the engine itself first.
Furthermore the engine fits the internship where I want to go so having more projects in the Unity engine would benefit my skills and chance to get accepted.
